### **Tier 1: Foundational Fixes & Quick Wins**

These items should be addressed first. They either fix critical reliability issues or provide a high return on investment for a low amount of engineering effort.

1.  **Production-Grade State Management (Redis for Paused Tasks)**
    *   **Why:** This is the highest priority. It fixes a critical bug where a server restart causes irreversible data loss for paused tasks. The impact on system reliability is immense, and the effort is relatively low since the BEND stack already provides Redis. This is a foundational prerequisite for any serious, long-running agentic work.

2.  **Agent SDK & Tooling Enhancements (Improve `new-tool` script)**
    *   **Why:** This is a classic "sharpen the saw" task. The effort to enhance the new tool scaffolding script is very low, but the impact on developer velocity and code consistency is high. Every new tool will be created faster and with fewer errors. It's a massive quality-of-life improvement for anyone extending the agent.

3.  **Advanced Prompt Engineering Toolkit (Modular PromptBuilder)**
    *   **Why:** Refactoring the current prompt string formatting into a dedicated `PromptBuilder` class is a low-effort, high-impact code quality improvement. It will make the planning step cleaner, more testable, and far easier to modify in the future when we implement more advanced context compression or dynamic role switching.

### **Tier 2: Core Capabilities & Observability**

These items represent the next major steps in maturing the framework. They require more effort than Tier 1 but are essential for enabling data-driven development and increasing agent robustness.

1.  **Re-integrate Advanced Observability (LangFuse)**
    *   **Why:** This is the gateway to truly understanding agent performance. While the effort is high due to the infrastructure complexity, its impact is a force multiplier. It makes debugging faster, provides invaluable insights, and is a hard dependency for the A/B testing suite. We cannot effectively measure improvement without it.

2.  **Advanced Evaluation Suite (A/B Testing)**
    *   **Why:** This is the *reason* for integrating LangFuse. Once observability is in place, this feature allows us to move from "I think this prompt is better" to "I can prove this prompt is 3% more effective on our benchmark dataset." It's the key to making the agent quantifiably better over time.

3.  **Dynamic Goal Management (`revise_goal` tool)**
    *   **Why:** Implementing the `revise_goal` tool is a relatively low-effort piece of the larger "Self-Reflection" feature. It provides an immediate, tangible boost to the agent's robustness by allowing it to self-correct from a flawed or ambiguous user prompt, which is a common failure mode.

### **Tier 3: Advanced Intelligence & Major Features**

These are the horizon-defining, "level-up" features. They have the highest potential impact but also require the most significant engineering effort. They should be tackled after the foundational work in Tiers 1 and 2 is complete.

1.  **Hierarchical Planning (Sub-goal Decomposition)**
    *   **Why:** This fundamentally changes the agent's problem-solving ability, enabling it to tackle much larger and more complex tasks. However, it requires significant changes to the core `TaskState` and planning logic.

2.  **Multimodal Perception (Vision)**
    *   **Why:** This opens up an entirely new domain of GUI automation, massively expanding the agent's capabilities. The effort is high as it involves adding a new VLM service to BEND, creating new providers, and developing new vision-based tools.

In summary, the immediate focus should be on **stabilizing the core (Redis state), improving the developer loop (SDK), and refactoring for future growth (PromptBuilder).** Once that foundation is rock-solid, we can re-establish our advanced observability (LangFuse) and then use that to build and measure the next generation of truly advanced agent intelligence.
