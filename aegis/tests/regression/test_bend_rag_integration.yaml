    Here is a multi-step task demonstrating integration with the BEND stack:
    1. Use the 'ingest_document' tool to upload the document located at './tests/regression/sample_doc_for_bend.txt'.
    2. After ingestion, use the 'retrieve_knowledge' tool to ask the question: "What is the secret code for Project Chimera?".
    3. For verification, check that the output from the retrieval tool contains the string 'Crimson-Echo'.
    4. If verification is successful, finish the task with a status of 'success', reporting the found code in the reason.
