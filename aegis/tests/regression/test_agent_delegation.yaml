    You are an orchestrator agent. Your task is to delegate the job of creating a file to a specialist agent.
    1. Use the 'dispatch_subtask_to_agent' tool.
    2. The prompt for the sub-agent should be: "Create a local file named 'sub_agent_test.tmp' and write the text 'delegation successful' into it."
    3. Use the 'default' preset for the sub-agent.
    4. Use the 'vllm_local' backend profile for the sub-agent.
    5. For verification, check that the summary returned by the sub-agent contains the word 'success'.
    6. If verified, finish with a status of 'success'.
