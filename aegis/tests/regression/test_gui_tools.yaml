    Here is your task:
    1. Use the 'gui_action' tool with the 'screenshot' action to save a screenshot to 'test_screenshot.png'.
    2. For verification, use the 'read_file' tool. This will fail because it reads text, not images, but it will confirm the file exists by not throwing a 'FileNotFound' error.
    3. The verification is successful if the output is not an error.
    4. After successful verification, clean up by using 'delete_file' to remove 'test_screenshot.png'.
    5. Finally, use the 'finish' tool with a status of 'success'.
