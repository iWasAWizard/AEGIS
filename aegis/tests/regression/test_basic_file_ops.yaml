  prompt: >
    Here is your task:
    1. Use the 'write_to_file' tool to create a local file named 'test_file.tmp' with the exact string 'hello world'.
    2. For verification, use the 'read_file' tool to confirm the content of 'test_file.tmp' is 'hello world'.
    3. The verification is successful if the tool output is exactly 'hello world'.
    4. After successful verification, use the 'delete_file' tool to clean up 'test_file.tmp'.
    5. Finally, use the 'finish' tool with a status of 'success'.
  expected_output: >
    The task was to create a file named 'test_file.tmp' with the content 'hello world', verify its contents, and then delete it.
    I successfully used the `write_to_file` tool to create the file.
    I then used the `read_file` tool and confirmed the content was 'hello world'.
    Finally, I cleaned up by deleting the file with the `delete_file` tool. The task is complete.
