    Here is your task:
    1. Create a local file named 'test_file.tmp' in the current directory.
    2. Write the exact string 'hello world' into this file.
    3. For verification, read the content of the file and confirm it is 'hello world'.
    4. If the content is correct, use the 'finish' tool with a status of 'success'. Otherwise, finish with a status of 'failure'.
    5. Clean up by deleting the 'test_file.tmp' file before finishing.
