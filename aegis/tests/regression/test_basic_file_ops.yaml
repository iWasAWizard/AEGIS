    Here is your task:
    1. Use the 'write_to_file' tool to create a local file named 'test_file.tmp' with the exact string 'hello world'.
    2. For verification, use the 'read_file' tool to confirm the content of 'test_file.tmp' is 'hello world'.
    3. The verification is successful if the tool output is exactly 'hello world'.
    4. After successful verification, use the 'delete_file' tool to clean up 'test_file.tmp'.
