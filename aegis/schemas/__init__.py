"""
The `schemas` package defines all Pydantic models used for data validation
and structured data transfer within the AEGIS framework.

This includes schemas for agent configuration, tool inputs, task state,
and API request/response bodies. By centralizing these models, we ensure
type safety and consistency across the entire application.
