"""
The `utils` package provides a collection of helper modules and utilities
that support the core functionality of the AEGIS framework.

This includes modules for logging, configuration loading, tool discovery,
data sanitization, and report generation. These utilities are designed to be
reusable and to encapsulate common, cross-cutting concerns.
