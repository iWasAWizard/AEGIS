"""
The `primitives` package provides the fundamental, low-level building blocks
for agent actions.

Each tool in this package is designed to perform a single, discrete operation,
such as running one shell command, checking one port, or transferring one file.
These primitives are then composed by higher-level wrapper tools to create more
complex and robust behaviors.
